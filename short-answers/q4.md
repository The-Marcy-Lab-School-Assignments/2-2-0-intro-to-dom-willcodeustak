# Question

When would you want to use `.innerHTML` to create some new html, and when would you want to use `.createElement` and node updates?

# Answer

.innerHTML 

- Simple content updates
- Static content
- replacing large content within an element
- <!-- "Attackers can use the HTML <script> tag to insert and run malicious code in your app" --> Security risk


.createElement 
-  more dynamic content
- DOM manipulation
- more secure

.innerHTML is more straight to the point since it is static, again for large amounts of HTML it would be faster to use .innerHTML rather than going through DOM

.createElement allows for more control with your elements allowing you to customize a style or set event listeners etc.

- more "readable" easier to maintain.

Your response is unclear! Make sure you are answering the question asked. You can break down this question into two parts:

- When should you use `.innerHTML`?
- When should you use `.createElement`?

In addition you can talk about some benefits of using one over the other!
