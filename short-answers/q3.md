# Question

What's the difference between `.innerText` and `.textContent`?

# Answer

<!-- textContents is all text contained by an element and all its children that are for formatting purposes only.

- when you want to retrieve or set all text content within an element, regardless of its visibility.

innerText returns all text contained by an element and its child elements.

- when you want to retrieve or set the visible text content of an element, similar to what a user would see on the screen. -->

.innerText is for text that reflects what is visible to the user.

- considers CSS styles applied to elements
- innerText reads content as it appears on screen, ignores hidden content, and observes formatting of text

.textContent for efficient, unstyled text manipulation.

- generally for the developers
- does not consider styles.
- textContent reads content as it appears in the markup. This means it reads hidden content too. But it also ignores formatting like white spaces and line breaks

both ignore the HTML tags treat them as part of the text
