# Question

What's the difference between `.innerText` and `.textContent`?

# Answer

textContents is all text contained by an element and all its children that are for formatting purposes only.

- when you want to retrieve or set all text content within an element, regardless of its visibility.

innerText returns all text contained by an element and its child elements.

- when you want to retrieve or set the visible text content of an element, similar to what a user would see on the screen.
